    <h1 class="aboutme">A Little About Me</h1>
    <p id="content" class="intro">My name is Sam Zaintz and I am a senior studying Television, Radio, and Film at Syracuse University. Last semester, I had the opportunity to study abroad in London, which was absolutely amazing. London is a vibrant city full of history, culture, food, and adventure wherever you go.  Before my experience abroad, I talked to people who went abroad there previously, and they gave me a guide with places to go, food to eat, and general tips and tricks for navigating London. My page will do just the same by providing my honest opinion about Londonâ€™s main attractions, or ones you may not know about! Click above to find out about the best daytime and nighttime activities based on my own experience in London.
