    <h1>Nightlife</h1>
    <p>London is known for its exciting, versatile nightlife (in fact, the Syracuse London program offers a course about the business of nightlife!). Whether you want a crazy or chill night out, there is always an option. Here are some of the places I went to:</p>

    <h2>Puttshack</h2>

    <p>My friend and I decided at the last minute to go here, and it was a great decision. Puttshack is a high-tech mini golf place that serves food and drinks (in fact, you can get the food and drinks served to whichever hole you are at). You can go here with a friend or a bigger group. </p>

    <h2>Heaven Nightclub</h2>
    <img src="../media/heaven.jpg" alt="heaven" width="400">
    <p>London has many clubs, but this is one of their most legendary ones. This club is popular among the LGBTQ+ community, creating a very welcoming environment. Even though the room gets crowded, there was a lot of room to dance/move around and did not feel claustrophobic whatsoever. It has AMAZING throwback music.</p>

    <h2>West End Shows</h2>

    <p>Wicked, Hamilton, Book of Mormon, you name it, the West End has it. West End is the Broadway of London, home to many theaters and shows for relatively cheap prices. The Book of Mormon was my favorite play I’ve seen. Hamilton was amazing too, especially because tickets for Hamilton on Broadway in New York City are very hard to get. My friend recommends seeing “And Juliet”, a modern take on the Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. </p>

    <h2>Pubs</h2>
    <p>Going to any pub makes you feel like a local. There are pubs essentially at every corner, and it is a great place to go if you want a casual, relaxing night with reasonably priced drinks. My friends and I went to Marlborough Head, located right near our flat. Surprisingly, the pub fish and chips were delicious!</p>

    <h2>The Piano Works</h2>
    <img src="../media/pianoworks.jpg" alt="pianoworks" width="400">
    <p>Going here was definitely a highlight. It is a live music venue and bar. There are piano vocalists and other accompanying musicians that play songs of the audience’s choosing, whether it be 70s, pop, or even rap. This is such a fun place to sing, dance, and socialize. </p>

    <h2>Cahoots</h2>
    <img src="../media/cahoots.jpg" alt="cahoots" width="400">
    <p>London has many cocktail bars, but Cahoots was the most unique one I went to. It is inside an abandoned underground tube station. It makes you feel like you are in the 1940s, especially with the jazz music and menus that look like old newspapers! It is very laid back, but make a reservation in advance because the space is small.</p>

    <h2>Chinatown</h2>
    <img src="../media/chinatown.jpg" alt="chinatown1" width="400">
    <img src="../media/chinatown2.jpg" alt="chinatown2" width="400">
    <img src="../media/oneills.jpg" alt="oneills" width="400">
    <p>Chinatown is lively during the day and at night. The area has many bars and authentic late-night eats. The student bar called O’Neills was located here, and it had a band every night!</p>

    <h2>Snog Ice Cream</h2>
    <img src="../media/snog.jpg" alt="snog" width="400">
    <p>Here is a perfect example of a chill night. My friend and I went here too frequently for delicious frozen yogurt. Luckily, it was walking distance from our apartment (approximately 10 minutes) when we wanted a late-night snack. </p>
