    <h1>Day Activities</h1>
    <p id="content" class="daytime">It is impossible to be bored in London during the day. There are endless activities that you can do in rain or shine, with friends or by yourself, on weekdays or weekends. Everywhere is very accessible thanks to the Tube (London's simple, easy-to-navigate transit system). Here are some notable places I went during the day (in no particular order). </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div>
            <p class="h2">Buckingham Palace</p>
            <p class="descriptions">Buckingham Palace is one of the most iconic buildings and tourist attractions in London. The Changing of the Guard occurs every other day, and the ceremony schedule is listed online. I recommend not waiting until the last minute to show up. It gets crowded fast, even in the middle of the week.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="h2">Covent Garden</p>
            <p class="descriptions">This was my favorite place in London that is located in a great area. Down every alley, there is endless food and shopping. On your stroll, you will see markets (Apple Market, Jubilee Market, etc.) filled with shops, indie market stalls, and other quirky places. My favorite place was Whittard’s Tea because I took advantage of the free samples! Also, Neal’s Yard is a must (just a 5 minute walk away). It is a colorful courtyard with, you guessed it, more food and shopping. I recommend going to Homeslice Pizza in Neal’s Yard- it is amazing. Right next to Neal’s Yard is Seven Dials Market, which is a food court with other vendors as well.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div>
            <p class="h2">London Eye</p>
            <p class="descriptions">So fun, but not necessary to do it more than once. You get a great view of London, especially the Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. My roommate and I went during sunset and it was beautiful. Make sure to check the weather before you go! Luckily, it is very easy to get tickets online and the wait in line is not too bad considering how many pods there are on the ferris wheel. </p>

        <div>
            <p class="h2">Westminster Abbey</p>
            <p class="descriptions">Westminster Abbey is beautiful from the outside, but having the chance to get an audio guided tour inside is a must. The history behind the church was so interesting to hear about. The church is a burial site for many monarchs. One of the coolest parts was Poets’ corner. It is a burial site and place of commemoration for famous writers, playwrights, and poets like Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy, Charles Dickens (this sounds creepy, but is so cool, I promise)!</p>

        <div>
            <p class="h2">Hyde Park</p>
            <p class="descriptions">Hyde Park is the largest Royal Park in Central London. Even thought it is located in a busy area, it is so nice and relaxing. Definitely check out Kensington Palace and Kensington Gardens. In the spring, my friend and I always rented bikes and rode on the path. </p>

        <div>
            <p class="h2">Hampstead Heath</p>
            <p class="descriptions">Hampstead Heath is an affluent area in London. After eating and shopping in the cute town, my friends and I walked up to Parliament Hill to get an amazing view of London and enjoy the nice weather. We went in April, and there happened to be a fun fair there, which was a nice bonus. Overall, this is a great place to go to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div>
            <p class="h2">Notting Hill</p>
            <p class="descriptions">Another classic tourist attraction. Go to Lancaster Road to see the colorful houses. After taking pictures and admiring the houses for a few minutes, we went to Portobello Market on Portobello Road, which is open on Saturdays. Warning: it gets VERY crowded. However, there are still some vendors open during the week, and it is a much better experience without the crowd. While in Notting Hill, go to the Museum of Brands to see the history of products beginning in the 19th century (my parents loved it because they got to see products from their childhood displayed around the museum).</p>

        <div>
            <p class="h2">High Tea/Afternoon Tea</p>
            <p class="descriptions">To feel like an authentic, classy Brit, definitely go for high tea during the day. Around London, there are endless places to go with varying price ranges. Definitely book far in advance, as tables get taken up quickly. I went to Sketch and it was such a cool experience (mainly because of the Instagram-worthy bathrooms). I also went to The Muffin Man Tea Shop, which was a much cheaper option, yet much better food than Sketch in my opinion. </p>

        <div>
            <p class="h2">Endless Shopping (Selfridges and Harrods)</p>
            <p class="descriptions">If you think Bloomingdales is a nice department store, think again. I was lucky enough to live right near Selfridges. Even though it is very high end, it is so much fun to walk around and look at designer clothes, shoes, perfume, makeup, technology, and so much more. There also is a great food court and market. I ALWAYS got the gelato (its amazing). Harrods is the more famous department store and is much bigger than Selfridges (which I did not think was possible). Although there are high end items, there is a huge Harrods Gift shop in the basement level worth checking out, especially to buy some of Harrod’s famous shortbread cookies. Overall, London has shopping everywhere you go.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="h2">Spitalfields/Brick Lane Vintage Market</p>
            <p class="descriptions">I wouldn't say this is a main tourist attraction, but it is definitely worth checking out if you have time to go to East London. Spitalfields is a market that sells vintage clothing, accessories, art, street food, and more. I loved this market because it is a different vibe than those located in West London (it felt more laid back and artsy). Brick Lane Vintage Market is open every Sunday, and sells every kind of vintage clothing item imaginable. Although it was fun looking through everything, it was very, very hot because Brick Lane is underground. </p>

            <p class="h2">Thames River Cruise</p>
            <p class="descriptions">In my opinion, this was not neccessary to do and was slightly boring. Even though you see a lot of the sites, it is much better to see them close-up in person instead of through a boat window. The cruise dropped us off at Tower Bridge. </p>
