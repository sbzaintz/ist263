        My name is Samantha Zaintz, and I am a senior studying Television, Radio, and Film with a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am interested in comedy, production, and post-production, but I am always open to any opportunity. This summer, I interned at Sorrentino Media, a boutique production company, as well as Underground Overground Comedy, a pop-up comedy show that takes places in unique locations in New York City. Along with academics and internship, I love to travel and paint.
